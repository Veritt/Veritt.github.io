            <h3>What are Roguelike games?</h3>
            <p>A type of game that can branch off other genres like Action/RPG/FPS that revolves around the player going through procedurally-generated levels, perma-death, unique items/modifiers that can change the way you play and making each run different.</p>
            <p>Not every game is the same!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Roguelites:</b> The more modern version of roguelikes, usually more action-focused and has meta-progression, where players can unlock permament upgrades to use on the next run. Such games that fall under this is <i>Roboquest</i>, <i>Dead Cells</i>, and <i>Risk of Rain 2</i>.</li>

                <li><b>Deck-building Roguelikes:</b> More centered around making builds/decks as powerful as they can be with the player collecting their upgrades through different kinds of cards and perks that have different effects. My favorites would include <i>Slay the Spire</i>, <i>Nubby's Number Factory</i>, <i>Balatro</i>. </li>

                <li><b>Tactical Roguelikes:</b> More based around strategic, turn-based combat that the player can plan around by managing units and resources to achieve a goal. Examples include <i>NO-SKIN</i>, <i>Wildermyth</i>, <i>Darkest Dungeon</i>.</li>

        <!-- About Me Section -->
        <section id="who">
            <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I'm Lucas Manyvongsa, and I'm 22 years old, was born in Charlotte, NC, but my parents originally came from Laos. Besides spending my time doing work or rotting on my bed, I like to play roguelikes as it was something that I didn't have to fully commit to like a story-based game. I would say from memory that the earliest game of that genre that I played was <i>Binding of Issac</i>. I just loved all the wacky builds you could make in that game and the skill it took to win a run.</p>

            <p>TLDR: I'm lazy as hell, and I like big number go up kind of games.</p>

            <h2 class="center">When</h2>
            <h3>When do I play roguelikes?</h3>
            <p>I'm not going to lie to you, at anytime. When I get home, when I'm out of class, when I'm at my grandpa's funeral, when I die.</p>

        <!-- Where Section -->
        <section id="where">
            <h2 class="center">Where</h2>
            <h3>Where do I play Roguelikes?</h3>
            <p>I could do it <b>anywhere</b>. On top of your mother, in my house, at a restaurant, on my deathbed. As they are very portable games that be played in various locations.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- How Section -->
        <section id="how">
            <h2 class="center">How</h2>
            <h3>How do I play Roguelikes?</h3>
            <p>So it depends on which game you are playing, find one that interests you and just start playing. Most will have a tutorial or just throw you straight into a run, you get a feel for them and will learn about certain mechanics and more meta about the game. <i>What's the best item?</i> <i>How can I optimize my run to be better?</i> <i>Will I find love in my empty life in this eternal suffering of the mortal plane?</i> </p>

            <p>There are many game wikis you can read up on, with item descriptions, npcs, and special game mechanics.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Why</h2>
            <h3>Why do I play Roguelikes?</h3>
            <P>To fill the void. Bigger numbers is the only thing that gives me happiness. Also to kill my pc, and regret my short/long-term decisions. All of these sound like negatives, but I think differently. As all these things lead to a more analytical mindset of observing what works and what doesn't, so future runs don't repeat the mistakes of the past. </p>
                <p><i>What could have been?</I> NAH. <b>Next Run.</b> We keep going until I feel like I'm a mummified husk and feel the incredible weight of my loss. Just the like the loss of my grandfather. <b>BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.</b> I NEED THOSE PANTS IN NUBBY'S NUMBER FACTORY, I NEED SACRED HEART IN BINDING OF ISSAC, I NEED ATG AND LENS-MAKER GLASSES PRINTERS IN RISK OF RAIN 2. RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</P>
